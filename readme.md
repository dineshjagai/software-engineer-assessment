## React

Build a React + TypeScript application utilizing the GitHub API to show data related to a given user. 

### Requirements

Use Create React App or Next.js to avoid wasting time on configuration. 

The app only has one page /. Hence, no routing required. 

The app fetches the results from this API call (https://api.github.com/users/[your-github-username]) with any GitHub username. 

The user enters the GitHub username in a search bar.

After the result has been fetched, present the following on the page: 

- Name 
- Bio 
- Username 
- Email
- Avatar (Through Avatar URL). 

The app should look reasonably nice and be mobile responsive. Don't use a CSS framework.
